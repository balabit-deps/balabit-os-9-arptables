arptables (0.0.4+snapshot20181021-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  All the arptables binaries have been moved away from /sbin to
  /usr/sbin. Some compatibility symlinks have been added for the
  Buster release cycle, but please make sure your scripts aren't using
  hardcoded binary paths.

  The plan is to drop the symlinks in Bullseye, the release after
  Buster.
